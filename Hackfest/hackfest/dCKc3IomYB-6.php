Arvind Kejriwal has finally ceased all the money from all the politicians' Swiss Bank Accounts. Too bad for this nation, you are the most corrupt politician who can go to any extent to get his money back. You have an advantage of being good with programming theory. You have managed your hands on to this <a href="/dCKc3IomYB-6/">directory</a>, which gives you various executables. They are all the same; but for different platforms (Windows x86, Linux x86, Linux x64, and Mac OS X x64). Your spy told you that when Kejriwal types the command to execute the program, he types his password along as an argument. Poor spy got caught before he could send you the password. However, he managed to send you this text file which contains part of the algorithm of his login program. You have intel from you vulnerability detector that if somehow you can crash the program, it will dump the password.

You have taken an oath that you won't proceed to another level without retrieving your money. So we have made sure that you keep up to your promise :-)

******Algorithm File*******<br /><br />

include necessary header files<br />
take argument 1 from console<br />
declare an array of 100 characters and name it passwd<br />
use strcpy () to copy argument 1 into passwd<br />
check if passwd is<br /><br />
