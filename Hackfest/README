Hackfest is a collection of challanges aimed at testing students' skills in different areas of security, namely Encryption, Buffer Overflow, Injections, Steganography, understanding of HTML+JavaScript+PHP, Basic Programming and logical thinking and so forth.

The project was created by me and a friend, to be used for the CS and IT Fest conducted by my school.
